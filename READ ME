In this repository, our objective is to explore and utilize various options and capabilities of MySQL using synthetic data. 
These data refer to record companies, artists, albums, and songs. To achieve this, we have established a database named 'record_company',
which encompasses the relevant tables (refer to the file named 'Database and Tables').
